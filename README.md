# Fuzzy-C-Means

This project involves implementing a fuzzy c-means algorithm, which is like the k-means algorithm for clustering.  
This is implemented by using fuzzy values and rules. Each iteration updates the leaders of each cluster, and the membership value of the data is calculated for each of these leaders.  
## The following are some of the results:
